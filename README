NAME
    Tak - Multi host remote control over ssh

SYNOPSIS
      bin/tak -h user1@host1 -h user2@host2 exec cat /etc/hostname

    or

      in Takfile:

      package Tak::MyScript;
  
      use Tak::Takfile;
      use Tak::ObjectClient;
  
      sub each_get_homedir {
        my ($self, $remote) = @_;
        my $oc = Tak::ObjectClient->new(remote => $remote);
        my $home = $oc->new_object('Path::Class::Dir')->absolute->stringify;
        $self->stdout->print(
          $remote->host.': '.$home."\n"
        );
      }
  
      1;

    then

      tak -h something get-homedir

WHERE'S THE REST?
    A drink leaked in my bag on the way back from LPW. My laptop is finally
    alive again though so I'll try and turn my slides into a vague attempt
    at documentation while I'm traveling to/from christmas things.
